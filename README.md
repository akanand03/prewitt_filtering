# prewitt_filtering
- Prewitt filtering is an image processing technique used for edge detection and gradient estimation. It is similar to the Sobel operator and the Roberts cross operator in its purpose but uses a different set of convolution kernels. Prewitt operators are designed to approximate the gradient of an image, which can help identify edges and regions of rapid intensity changes.

- Prewitt operators consist of two 3x3 convolution kernels: one for detecting edges in the horizontal direction (along the x-axis) and one for detecting edges in the vertical direction (along the y-axis)
